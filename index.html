    <h1>W.O.W. Projects</h1>
    <p>A portfolio of projects completed by William Whitehead.</p>
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p1>
      I started building things at my home in Davis, CA.  My earliest projects, starting in primary school, were wood and glue contraptions, but I quickly expanded my materials and methods as a reached for new goals.  My earliest substantial project was a RC sailing boat, which introduced me to the possibilities of electronics.  Many more projects followed.
      <br>
      <br>
        My projects have been fueled by substantial access to tools at home, and by ideas and suggestions from my father, who also loves to design and build things.  From my father I have access to a small selection of machine tools, and I have built up a collection of my own equipment for building the circuits I want for my projects.
