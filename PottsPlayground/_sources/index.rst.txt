Welcome to PottsPlayground's documentation!
===========================================

PottsPlayground is for constructing and simulating combinatorial optimization problems represented as a Potts Model.  It includes a system for constructing weight matrices in Python and C++/CUDA extensions for minimizing the Potts model energy on a CPU or GPU using various flavors of simulated annealing.

Several example combinatorial problems are built-in, ranging from simple graph coloring to logic element placement for Ice40 FPGAs.  There are also methods for converting any Potts model into an Ising model, and for creating minor-embedded representations of Ising models.

It is intended as a demonstration of what the Potts model is and is not capable of, and as a tool for further research with the Potts model of computation.
