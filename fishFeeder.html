        <h2>Automatic Fish Feeder: Origins</h2>
        <p1>You're going on a trip for a week, and you won't be home to feed your fish.  Or maybe you're just lazy and never remember that your pet fish need to eat too.  Either way, you'd like to be covered: you want an automatic fish feeder, something that's reliable, can be set up in a minute, and is not one of those unappetizing blocks of food you could just chuck in the tank.</p1>
        <h2>System Design</h2>
        <p1>This fish feeder is a wheel with twelve pivoting trays along the circumference.  The wheel rotates on a stepper motor, and a dose is dispensed for the fish when a tray on the wheel reaches a designated drop point where the normal support for the tray is absent, allowing the tray to swing down and drop the food it contains.  This design is very simple to build and meets the design criteria of being reliable because it requires a single motor, no transmission, and no position feedback.</p1>
        <h2>Fish Feeder Implementation</h2>
        <p1>I built this fish feeder on a 4x4 inch piece of polycarbonate, centered on a stepper motor salvaged from a printer.  The wheel is 3d printed in nylon, using Shapeways' printing service. I had a little fun building the controlling PCB using acid etching at home, resulting in a nice bare-copper 2-sided board hosting a ATTINY85 microcontroller for managing the timing and microstepping of the motor.  The system is powered from a 18650 li-ion cell to provide months of run time, ensuring the reliability of the device.</p1>
        <br>
        <p1>For reference, here are design files including stl for the wheel, circuit schematic, and the Arduino source code for the ATTINY85 firmware.</p1>
