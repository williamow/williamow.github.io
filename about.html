    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p1>
      I started building things at my home in Davis, CA.  My earliest projects, starting in primary school, were wood and glue contraptions, but I quickly expanded my materials and methods as a reached for new goals.  My earliest substantial project was a RC sailing boat, which introduced me to the possibilities of electronics.  Many more projects followed.

        My projects have been fueled by substantial access to tools at home, and by ideas and suggestions from my father, who also loves to design and build things.  From my father I had access to a small selection of machine tools, and I built up a collection of my own equipment for building the circuits I want for my projects.

        <p1>Currently, I am studying electrical engineering at University of California, Los Angeles.</p1>
